        "## 1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans - The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "Definition: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data.\n",
        "Example: In a class Car, the data (like speed, engineStatus) is encapsulated within the object, and you might expose methods like accelerate() or brake() to interact with this data instead of directly changing the attributes.\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**\n",
        "Definition: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing complexity and allows the programmer to focus on high-level operations.\n",
        "Example: When using a Car object, you might interact with high-level methods like start() and stop() without needing to know the specifics of how the car's engine is started or stopped.\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**\n",
        "Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (the subclass or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (the superclass or parent class). This promotes code reuse.\n",
        "Example: A Vehicle class might have attributes like speed and fuelLevel, and a Car class can inherit these attributes from Vehicle, adding specific features like numberOfDoors.\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also refers to the ability for methods to have different behaviors depending on the object they are acting upon. This can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "Example: A method makeSound() can be defined in a superclass Animal. A Dog class might override this method to produce a \"bark,\" while a Cat class might override it to produce a \"meow.\"\n",
        "5. **Composition**\n",
        "Definition: Composition is a design principle in which one class contains references to other objects (instances of other classes), allowing for complex objects to be built from simpler ones. It is often described as a \"has-a\" relationship, as opposed to inheritance's \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
        "Example: A Car class may contain an instance of an Engine class, a Wheel class, etc. The car \"has\" an engine, rather than being an engine.\n",
        "These concepts together help create structured, reusable, and maintainable code by focusing on objects and their interactions."

        "Ans- The Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "The Diamond Problem arises in object-oriented programming when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from the same base class. This creates a \"diamond-shaped\" inheritance structure, where a class has two parent classes that share a common ancestor. The problem occurs when a method or attribute is inherited from the common ancestor in a way that creates ambiguity, especially if both child classes override or redefine methods or attributes.\n",

        "Example of the Diamond Problem:\n",

        "(b) Class D inherits from both B and C.\n",
        "Now, suppose that A has a method foo(), and both B and C override this method. When D calls foo(), there's ambiguity about which version of foo() should be called: the one from B or the one from C.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How Python Resolves the Diamond Problem**\n",
        "Python uses a method resolution order (MRO) to determine the order in which classes are searched for a method or attribute. The MRO defines the order in which the base classes are considered when searching for a method, ensuring that there is no ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
